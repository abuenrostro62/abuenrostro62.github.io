                <h4>Data Analyst, Science Educator</h4>

            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>I recently graduated from a 6-month intense Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp
                    from Northwestern University. During the program, I learned various computer programs,
                such as Python (Pandas, MAtplotlib, API's, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn) and JavaScript. 
                I also learned how to extract, transport, and load (ETL) large databases using SQL and 
                SQLAlchemy.</p>
                <p>In addition to extracting and analyzing large datasets, I learned how to visualize the data 
                    into interactive dashboards by using D3.js, Leaflet.js, HTML5/CSS3, and Tableau.</p>
                <p>Aside from learning and applying my new computer science knowledge, I am also a middle school science teacher
                    in Chicago's Little Village community. I have taught 6/7 grade for the past 6 years. 
                    Over 80% of Little Village's residents are of Mexican descent and the community is 
                    also home to the largest foreign-born Mexican population in all of Chicago. 
                    It also has one of highest crime rates in the city.</p>
                <p>Teaching in this community has taught me the resiliance that many students carry. Some of my
                    students surprise me at the amount of determination and ambition they have, despite all the 
                    trauma they have on their shoulders for living in their community. Needless to say, these students
                    go above and beyond in my science class because they respect their learning space, each other, and myself.</p>
                    <p>I also coordinated an after school Girls Who Code club for 5-8th girls. Please check out <a href="https://kanoongirlswhocode.weebly.com/" target="_blank"> our awesome website</a> my
                    students and I created. It describes who they are and some cool coding projects they created.
                    </p>
                <p>Lastly, I aspire to work for an organization/company whose primary mission is to promote the wellbeing
                    of citizens by creating opportunities for discussion and make data-driven decisions to improve the livelihood
                    of those individuals.</p>
