                <p>We were recently inspired by the documentary, ‘The Last Dance’. This docu-series focused on
                    Michael Jordan’s NBA experience as a Chicago Bulls’s All-Star player. In addition, the series also 
                    shed some light on Jordan's head coach, Phil Jackson, personal events that impacted his athleticism 
                    and insight on key teammates such as Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman.</p>
                    
                <p>We found this topic to be extremely relatable during these unprecedented times as American professional 
                    leagues have suspended their seasons. This was also a great opportunity to dive into non-health/medical data 
                    and further develop, enhance, and practice our coding skills. </p>

                <p>These are some examples of the statistical analysis that I carried out. I used JupyterLab,
                    Python Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scipy.stats, and Sklearn.</p>

                    players increased their attempts to make Three-Point Field Goals around the 2002-2003 season. The color 
                    scale on the right side of the plot determines the range of attempts made.</p>

                        there are more outliers during the 2000's seasons than in the 1980s. Statistical analysis
                        were performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>

                    we see from the boxplots that there was an increase in outliers, beginning particularly around the 2012-2013 season. Statistical analysis
                    were performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>
